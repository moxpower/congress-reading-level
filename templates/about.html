<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>Using politician's bioguide IDs I took the last ~82,000 characters from politicians' speeches in Congress using Sunlight Foundation's <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/">Capitol Words API</a>, and then ran them through Priceonomics Analysis Engine API's <a href="http://docs.analysisengine.apiary.io/#reference/detailed-examples/readinglevel">Reading Level test</a>. Although there are 5 unique indices returned, I used the composite index for calculations and display. I removed backslashes from the speeches and had 17 politicians with zero results from the Capitol Words API. I also removed and didn't use politicians whose reading level scores were negative (and there was one, Rep. Boost, that was especially low, albeit positive, that I didn't count). In total, 21 politicians were excluded from display and calculations.</p>
